## Project Overview

This tech demo showcases multiple real-time rendering techniques implemented in C++ and OpenGL.  
All features are toggleable from the in-app UI, and the scene demonstrates the integration of advanced shading, animation, and procedural effects.

## Implemented Features

Below is an overview of all implemented features and where they can be toggled in the UI.

| ID | Feature         | Description                 | ImgUi                     | Hotkey  | Time spent |
|----|-----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|---------|------------|
| F1 | Example Feature | This is an example feature. | Checkbox: Example Feature | shift+E | 4h         |

### F1. Example Feature
**Description:**  
This is an example feature.

**UI:**  
Switch: On/Off toggle located in the settings panel  
Hotkey: Ctrl+E to quickly enable/disable

**Implementation Details:**  
Explain the used technique and justify any choices you made (e.g., if there are multiple ways to implement a feature, justify why you chose a particular one). Each explanation should be accompanied by at least two screenshots (more are welcome) to clearly illustrate each method
